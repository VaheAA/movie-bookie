# API Project

This project provides a foundation for building a robust API using Node.js, TypeScript, and Express. It's designed to be easily scalable and adaptable to your specific data models and business logic.

## âœ¨ Features

- **TypeScript:**  Ensures type safety, catching errors during development and making your code more predictable.
- **Express:**  A flexible and widely-used framework for building APIs in Node.js.
- **Sequelize:**  Simplify database interactions with this powerful Object-Relational Mapper (ORM). Supports various databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and MSSQL).
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):**  Implement secure authentication and authorization to protect your API endpoints.
- **CORS:**  Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for seamless communication between your API and frontend applications (e.g., React, Angular, Vue).
- **Environment Variables:**  Safely manage configuration settings (API keys, database credentials, etc.) using `dotenv`.
- **Linting & Formatting:**  Maintain clean, consistent code with ESLint and Prettier.
- **Nodemon:**  Boost your development workflow with automatic server restarts when you make changes.
